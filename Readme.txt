 steps to build a simple server:


Include Necessary Header Files:
Include the required C header files for socket programming, such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, unistd.h, sys/socket.h, netinet/in.h, and arpa/inet.h.

Create a Socket:
Use the socket() function to create a socket for listening to incoming connections. Specify the address family (typically AF_INET for IPv4), socket type (SOCK_STREAM for TCP), and protocol (0 for default protocol).

Bind and Listen:
Bind the socket to a specific IP address and port using the bind() function. Then, use listen() to make the server listen for incoming connections.

Accept Connections:
Use the accept() function to accept incoming client connections. This function will block until a client connects.

Handle Client Requests:
Once a client connects, you'll need to read the HTTP request from the client, parse it to extract the requested file path or resource, and send an appropriate HTTP response.

Close Sockets:
After sending the response to the client, close both the client socket and the server socket.

Compile and Run:
Compile your C program using a C compiler like gcc, and then run the resulting executable.

Access Your Server:
Open a web browser and visit the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080) to see your server's response.
